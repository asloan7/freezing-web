# Uses wget to spider all the assets of a web site, as the simplest
# possible functional test. If any resources come back with 500 errors,
# wget will exit with a non-zero error code, and this will print the
# output of wget and try to highlight errors.
#
# See these 2 wget documentation pages for the inspiration that lead to
