<h1>Authorization Results</h1>
<p>
	Welcome, {{ athlete.firstname }}.
</p>
<p>
  	You have successfully logged in to Strava and authorized the Freezing Saddles application to read your rides.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have registered on the <a href="{{ registration_site }}">signup sheet</a>.
	Note: for the purposes of the registration form, your Strava user ID is <strong>{{ athlete.id }}</strong>.
	</li>
{% if no_teams %}
    <li><strong>Uh-oh, something went wrong</strong>. 
    So you are a Strava athlete, we get that. Unfortunately, one of these two things is true:
    <ol>
        <li>you did not give Strava permission for us to "View your complete Strava profile".
            Without that, we can't see what clubs you belong to.</li>
        <li>you are not registered with any of the configured Freezing Saddles team clubs; 
            if that is the case, <strong>You need to join a competition team Strava club.</strong> 
            Or maybe the app just needs to be updated to know about the Strava teams. 
            Don't worry, your rides will count but they won't be on any leaderboards until you have joined one of the
            competition teams. 
    </ol>
	</li>
{% elif multiple_teams %}
	<li><strong>Houston we have a problem</strong>.
    It looks like you joined _multiple_ Strava clubs that are registered as competition teams.  
    Here are the problematic teams (please ensure you are only a member of one of them):
		<ul>
			{% for team in multiple_teams %} 
			<li>{{ team.name }}</li>
			{% endfor %}
		</ul>  
	</li>
{% else %}
	<li>
		<strong>You are registered with a team!</strong>
        You are a member of the
		<strong>{{ team.name }}</strong> Strava club.
	</li>
    <li>
        View your <a href={{ rides_url }}>personal rides page.</a>
    </li>
{% endif %}
